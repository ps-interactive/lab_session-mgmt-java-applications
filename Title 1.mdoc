Title: Java Deserialization Security
Question: Which of the following is the most secure approach for handling object deserialization in Java?
A. Using the standard ObjectInputStream for all objects
B. Using ValidatingObjectInputStream with a whitelist of trusted classes
C. Checking the class name after deserialization
D. Using readObject() with try-catch to handle exceptions

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: ValidatingObjectInputStream with a whitelist of trusted classes provides the strongest security by restricting which classes can be deserialized, preventing attackers from executing arbitrary code through malicious serialized objects.
