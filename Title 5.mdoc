Title: ValidatingObjectInputStream Configuration
Question: When using ValidatingObjectInputStream, what is the purpose of the accept() method?
A. To reject specific classes from deserialization
B. To whitelist specific classes for deserialization
C. To validate the integrity of serialized data
D. To log deserialization attempts

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The accept() method in ValidatingObjectInputStream is used to specify which classes are allowed to be deserialized (the whitelist). Only classes explicitly accepted will be deserialized, and attempts to deserialize other classes will throw exceptions.
